Notes:

Need to ensure variables are overwitten when user gives them

Issues:
- cwd should not be able to be editied
- no saftey when loading a json file - program may crash if broken json loaded
- any variable used in the load button function may override and break the program if used in the custom varibale box,
  temperary fix has been enacted by not using any simple variable names ex i, v, j

Notes:
- when using pyinstaller use -D to get a way faster program, slightly more work for user to accesss first time but loads way quicker

To Do:
- no saftey when loading a json file - program may crash if broken json loaded
- would be good to check over variables section, should be able to use any variable that is not a
  python reserved <= 10 characters, but had to modify variable names so would be good to check
- currently the same number of steps are used for forwards and backwards time should be custome
- should not need to do forward and backward time at the same time
- Variable and Equation boxes should stretch
- Rung Kutta Needs added
- Too many warnings setting to shut all warnings off needed
- Need to make it so settings can be scrolled through so they are not quite so overwhelming (may need settings tabs)
- Initial background image needs to match properly
- Buttons background needs changed
- Need to be able to click on the plot to pick a point
- Need to have a little dot where the plot is being loaded from

Low Priority
- Would be good to generate a loading bar if plot it taking a while



To work will need
- pip install wx 
- pip install wx.html2 (It is a serious pain if you want these top 2 to work in linux)
- pip install numpy
- pip install plotly

(Should be in python to start)
- shutil
- json 
- os


Need to make a virtual environment when done otherwise pyinstaller includes 
every library installed system python environment which can be quite a few and end file will be bigger


Windows

Go into internals once compiled grab Graphs and Photos then place them in parent directory

Notes:

Need to ensure variables are overwitten when user gives them

Issues:
- no saftey when loading a json file - program may crash if broken json loaded
- would be good to check over variables section, should be able to use any variable that is not a
  python reserved <= 10 characters, but had to modify variable names so would be good to check
- when using pyinstaller use -D to get a way faster program, slightly more work for user to accesss first time but loads way quicker
- use the following for myself to load the application (Copy and past next line into terminal)
- currently the same number of steps are used for forwards and backwards time
- Currently no setting for disabeling backwards time, just forwards
- When window is streched variable box looks like it is getting bigger, but does not actually get bigger.

pyinstaller -D --icon="C:/Users/Samuel/Downloads/Programming related/Python/PPP/Photos/PPP Logo.png" --noconsole --add-binary "c:\Users\Samuel\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\wx\WebView2Loader.dll;.\wx" --add-data "C:/Users/Samuel/Downloads/Programming related/Python/PPP/Graphs;Graphs" --add-data "C:/Users/Samuel/Downloads/Programming related/Python/PPP/Photos;Photos" "C:/Users/Samuel/Downloads/Programming related/Python/PPP/Phase_Plot_App_Launcher.py"

(for linux replace the ; with :)
above line does not add Graphs or Photos folders properly, have to go into internals and then grab Graphs and Photos and copy them to parent directory

To work will need
- pip install wx 
- pip install wx.html2
- pip install shutil
- pip install json (should be included in python)
- pip install os (should be included in python)
- pip install numpy
- pip install plotly


Need to make a virtual environment when done otherwise pyinstaller includes 
every library I have installed to this python environment in the exe which makes it a bit bigger


Need to Bind the display.display to wx.whatever_it_is_that_is_called_when_display_is_resized
